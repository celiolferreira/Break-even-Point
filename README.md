# Break-even-Point

Extracting the break-even point to build a series of dashboards

This was one of the first jobs I did in SQL. 
It can be clearly seen by the (not so) good practices I used! LOL!
However, all these nested queries were the baseline that helped to develop my SQL studies.

For starters I reached out to the Oracle database in order to obtain the SUM of HR expenses.
Right after that I've got the sum of fixed expenses.
Then I calculated the grand total of sales minus taxes (net revenue).
And finally I applied the formula: TOTAL $ FIXED COSTS + FIXED EXPENSES / ( ( TOTAL $ SALES - TAXES - VARIABLE COSTS ) / 100 )
